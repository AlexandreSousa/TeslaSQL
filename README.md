## Getting started
TeslaSQL is in a really early state. You have to edit "assets/js/renderer.js" in order to get a connection. Remove the comments from this line at the top of the file and edit the connection params:  

`/*storage.set('connection', { server: 'localhost', user: 'huti', password: 'huti' }, function (error) {
    if (error) throw error;
});*/`

Then start the program with:  

`npm start`

Your connection params will now get stored on your drive. You have to close and restart the application now in order to connect to your server.
